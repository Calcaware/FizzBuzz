# Fizz Buzz
Various Fizz Buzz Implementations

# What is Fizz Buzz?
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.[1] Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

# In Programming
Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a relatively trivial problem requiring little more than a loop and conditional statements. However, its value in coding interviews is to analyze fundamental coding habits that may be indicative of overall coding ingenuity.

# Why?
Because sometimes I code small useless things when I'm bored, don't have a project in mind, having trouble sleeping, or just want to code for fun and don't feel like making something meaningful.
